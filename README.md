### **HTML Input Types: A Comprehensive Overview**

HTML provides a variety of **`<input>` types** that define the behavior and appearance of form fields. These input types enable developers to gather different kinds of data, such as text, numbers, dates, files, and more. Here's a breakdown of each HTML `<input>` type and how you can use it.

---

### 1. **`<input type="button">`**

#### Purpose:
The `button` input type is used to create a clickable button in a form. It doesn’t submit the form by default and can be programmed to perform custom actions with JavaScript.

#### Attributes:
- **`value`**: Defines the text on the button.
- **`onclick`**: Specifies the action to be performed when the button is clicked.

#### Example:

```html
<form>
  <input type="button" value="Click Me" onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">
</form>
```

#### Best Practices:
- Use for triggering JavaScript functions, such as showing modals or performing actions within the page.

---

### 2. **`<input type="checkbox">`**

#### Purpose:
The `checkbox` input type allows users to select one or more options from a list. It is commonly used for agreeing to terms and conditions or selecting multiple preferences.

#### Attributes:
- **`checked`**: Specifies if the checkbox is checked by default.
- **`required`**: Ensures the checkbox must be selected before submitting the form.
- **`value`**: Defines the value sent to the server when the checkbox is checked.

#### Example:

```html
<form>
  <input type="checkbox" id="subscribe" name="subscribe" checked> Subscribe to newsletter
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

#### Best Practices:
- Use for binary options (yes/no or agree/disagree) or when selecting multiple options.
- Ensure that **`required`** is used for necessary actions like agreeing to terms.
